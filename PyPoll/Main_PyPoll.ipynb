    "\n",
    "#You will be give a set of poll data called Pypoll_data.csv. \n",
    "#The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. \n",
    "#Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:\n",
    "\n",

    "#The total number of votes cast\n",
    "#A complete list of candidates who received votes\n",

    "#The total number of votes each candidate won\n",
    "#The winner of the election based on popular vote.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Election Results\n",
    "#  -------------------------\n",
    "#  Total Votes: 3521001\n",

    "#and to debug along the way. Using what we've learned, try to break down you tasks into discrete mini-objectives. \n",
    "#This will be a much better course of action than attempting to Google Search for a miracle.\n",
    "#As you will discover, for some of these challenges, the datasets are quite large. This was done purposefully, as it showcases one of the limits of Excel-based analysis. While our first instinct, as data analysts, is often to head straight into Excel, creating scripts in Python can provide us with more robust options for handling \"big data\".\n",
